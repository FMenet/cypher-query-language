# Cypher Query Language

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) syntax highlighting for
[Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/)'s [Cypher query language](http://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/).

Originally based on similar packages for [Atom](http://atom.io)
([language-cypher](https://github.com/tobiashm/language-cypher)) and
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ([Cypher](https://github.com/kollhof/sublime-cypher)).

# Fork Change

This fork is only intended to get the best of the cypher and graphql extensions for VSCode. I just injected one into the other.
